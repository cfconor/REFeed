# REFeed
A C# project built to automatically pull student records from a CSV and feed it into the Database of RaisersEdge, to generate mailing lists.

The programme reads in what data is available, updates the student addresses to a standardized format using Google Maps API, and adds them to the Raisers Edge Database directly.
